# Ministry of Defence (MoD) — Defence AI Strategy & Operational Assurance Platform

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern the **Defence AI Strategy & Operational Assurance Platform** for **Ministry of Defence**.

## Background

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) defends the UK and its interests. The Defence AI Strategy positions AI as essential for maintaining operational advantage. MoD is adopting AI across intelligence analysis, logistics, maintenance prediction, and autonomous systems while ensuring compliance with JSP 936 (AI Assurance) and international humanitarian law. The Defence AI Centre (DAIC) leads AI adoption across Defence.

## Project Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Defence Intelligence AI** | AI-enhanced intelligence analysis, imagery interpretation, and SIGINT processing |
| **Predictive Maintenance** | ML models for equipment maintenance prediction across platforms (land, sea, air) |
| **Autonomous Systems** | Governance framework for autonomous and semi-autonomous defence systems |
| **Logistics Optimisation** | AI for defence supply chain optimisation and resource allocation |
| **Simulation & Training** | AI-driven simulation, synthetic environments, and training systems |
| **Cyber Defence AI** | AI for cyber threat detection, network defence, and incident response |
